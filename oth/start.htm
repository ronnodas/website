<p> The online treasure hunt takes you through a series of mind-bending puzzles
    , each step leading to the next.</p>
<p> To go to next step, submit what you think the answer to the current puzzle 
    is in the 'Answer' box like the one below along with the 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha">captcha</a>. </p>
<p> If you submit a correct answer, you will be redirected to the next page, 
    otherwise the current page will refresh. If you want to take a break at any 
    point, just save the url of the puzzle you're on.</p>
<p>The answers are case, punctuation and space insensitive. So 'I love NY!' and 
    'iloveny' are treated exactly the same. If the answer is a phrase try the most 
    relevant words first. If there are multiple possible phrasings, most of them 
    should get you through. You should be able to see which level you're on at the 
    top and a link to the start (i.e. this page) at the bottom.</p>
<p>If you understand the rules, try the answer 'I understand' on this page to get 
    to the first level. Good luck and happy puzzling.</p>
